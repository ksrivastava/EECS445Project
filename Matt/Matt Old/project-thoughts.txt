Section 1. Introduction: Problem description and motivation. Why do you want to solve this problem? What's the impact if you can solve this problem?
Section 2. Proposed method: How are you going to solve this problem? Why should the proposed method work? Provide technical details of your approach if you are proposing a novel method.
Section 3. Related work: What are existing methods? What are the state-of-the-art methods for this problem? How is your approach different from the related work?
Section 4. Experimental results: Milestones achieved so far (add all relevant experimental results). How do these results support your claim?
Section 5. Future milestones: Dates and sub-goals (please set sub-goals on a weekly basis so that they can be done in a week)
Section 6. Conclusion: Summary of your progress and your final expected goal (what do you expect to achieve or demonstrate for the final project?)

Couples not necessarily started at first survey, may have been together long before 4+ years
	right now we  only predict if they will break up, not 4 years exactly since many break ups have been together longer
	should integrate length data if we really want to judge "will they make it 4 years"
Difference between marriage and relationship?
	break up and divorce much different - only have a few examples of divorce occuring
how to mix continuous data and binary data from categorical data
Same sex weighting?

Construct features based on research and intuition
	unemployment status during relationship
	if relationship doesn’t match what respondent’s sexual orientation
	length of relationship before cohabitation
	if races of partners don’t match
	age difference as continuous instead of categorical???
	change in education
	increase in number of children?

Consider external data set
	NCHS Marriage and Divorce Data
	Only has demographic and some household information

eecs 445 project work progress report due 11/7 @ 1155p
	dianostics and error analysis
	control experiments
	justify algorithmic claims - sanity check
